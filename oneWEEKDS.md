### **Execution Protocol**  
```markdown
Week 1: Problems 1-2 + Revisions  
Week 2: Problems 3-4 + Revisions  
Week 3: Problems 5-6 + Revisions  
Week 4: Problem 7 + Mock all  
Repeat for 4 months → Total 28 problems with 28 revisions  
```

### **Why These 7?**  
1. **Pattern Density:** Each teaches 2-3 concepts  
2. **Fear Coverage:** Contains edge cases you’ve avoided (empty strings, negative nums)  
3. **FAANG Frequency:** All appear in top 50 most asked

### **Pro Tip**  
After solving each pair:  
1. Write 3-line pattern summary  
2. Code template for future use  
3. Add 2 edge test cases to your cheatsheet
