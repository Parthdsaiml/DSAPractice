Here are the **Top 10** important patterns used in solving array-related problems:

1. **Sliding Window Pattern**
2. **Two Pointer Pattern**
3. **Kadane's Algorithm (Maximum Subarray Sum)**
4. **Prefix Sum Pattern**
5. **Suffix Sum Pattern**
6. **Binary Search Pattern**
7. **Greedy Pattern**
8. **Hashing Pattern**
9. **Cycle Detection Pattern**
10. **Merge Intervals Pattern**

These patterns are widely applicable and form the foundation for solving many types of array-based problems efficiently.
