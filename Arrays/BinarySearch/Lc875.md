# ![**Leetcode 875: Koko Eating Bananas**](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/)  

**Problem Statement:** 


Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `piles` of bananas, and the `i`-th pile has `piles[i]` bananas. Koko can decide her eating speed per hour, `k`. Each hour, she chooses a pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from it. If the pile has fewer than `k` bananas, she eats all of them and moves to the next hour. Koko wants to finish eating all the bananas before her guard returns after `h` hours.  

**Key Idea:**  
The problem is about finding the minimum eating speed `k` such that Koko can finish all piles within `h` hours.

### **Test Cases and Explanation:**

**Test Case 1:**  
- **Input:** `piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8`  
- **Explanation:**  
  - If Koko eats at a speed of `4 bananas/hour`, she finishes all piles in exactly 8 hours:  
    - Pile 3 → 1 hour  
    - Pile 6 → 2 hours  
    - Pile 7 → 2 hours  
    - Pile 11 → 3 hours  
  - Total: 8 hours  
- **Result:** The minimum speed is `4`.

---

**Test Case 2:**  
- **Input:** `piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5`  
- **Explanation:**  
  - If Koko tries eating too slowly (e.g., `20/hour`), she won’t finish on time.  
  - The solution requires searching for the optimal speed that fits within 5 hours.  
- **Result:** Minimum speed is found using binary search.

---

**Test Case 3 (Edge Case):**  
- **Input:** `piles = [1], h = 1`  
- **Explanation:**  
  - Only one pile with one banana.  
  - Eating speed must be at least 1.  
- **Result:** Minimum speed is `1`.

---

### **Key Points:**  
- The search space for `k` ranges from 1 to the maximum number of bananas in a pile.  
- The problem requires checking if Koko can finish with a given speed within `h` hours using a helper function.  
- A binary search approach is optimal to find the minimum feasible speed.  

### Solution

```python
class Solution {
    public int minEatingSpeed(int[] piles, int h) {
        int end = 0;

       
        for (int pile : piles) {
            if (pile > end) {
                end = pile;
            }
        }

        int start = 1;

        while (start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            int hours = 0;  // Keep track of total hours required

            // Calculate hours inline instead of using a separate function
            for (int pile : piles) {
                hours += (pile + mid - 1) / mid;  
                if (hours > h) break;  // Early exit to optimize time
            }

            if (hours <= h) {
                end = mid; 
            } else {
                start = mid + 1;  
            }
        }
        return start;  
    }
}
```

Explanation of the Code
Finding the Maximum Pile: The first loop iterates through the piles array to find the maximum number of bananas in a single pile. This value will serve as the upper limit for our binary search.

Setting Up Binary Search: We initialize start to 1, as the minimum speed cannot be less than 1 banana per hour. The binary search continues until start is less than end.

Calculating Required Hours: For each mid-point speed, we calculate how many hours it would take to eat all the bananas. The formula (pile + mid - 1) / mid effectively calculates the ceiling of pile / mid, which gives the number of hours needed for that pile.

Adjusting the Search Range: If the total hours required is less than or equal to h, we can potentially reduce the speed, so we set end to mid. If it exceeds h, we need to increase the speed, so we set start to mid + 1.

Returning the Result: Once the loop concludes, start will hold the minimum eating speed required to finish all piles within the given hours.
