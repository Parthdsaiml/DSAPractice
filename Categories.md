### **Primary (Non-Negotiable, Must Do) âœ…**  
1. **DSA** â€“ 300-400 good problems (recursion, DP, trees, graphs, bit manipulation).  
2. **OOPs & System Design** â€“ For coding rounds + interviews.  
3. **At least ONE Core Skill (Web Dev OR AI/ML)** â€“ Deep expertise in one, not both half-baked.  
4. **Aptitude (Basic Level)** â€“ Just enough for placement tests.  

### **Secondary (Boosts Your Profile, Not Mandatory) âš¡**  
1. **Real-World Projects** â€“ AI agents, JobVault, ScrollLess (needs deployment & traction).  
2. **Internships/Freelancing** â€“ Adds credibility, real work beats 10 side projects.  
3. **Networking & Personal Branding** â€“ LinkedIn, GitHub, Open Source (80% of people ignore this, big mistake).  
4. **MLOps / DevOps / Scaling Knowledge** â€“ Makes you 10x better than basic devs.  

### **Tertiary (Good to Have, But Optional) ðŸŽ¯**  
1. **Competitive Programming** â€“ Only if you aim for top-tier product companies (GFG, Codeforces).  
2. **Extra Certifications** â€“ Can help, but wonâ€™t replace real skills.  
3. **Exploring New Tech (Web3, Quantum, etc.)** â€“ Fun, but focus on employability first.
