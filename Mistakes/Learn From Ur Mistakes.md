### Key Points to Remember for Similar Problems (Learning from Mistakes):  

- **Use Sorting for Pattern Matching:** Sorting strings creates a unique key for grouping patterns.  
- **HashMap for Grouping:** Store sorted strings as keys and group anagrams in lists.  
- **`putIfAbsent()` Shortcut:** Quickly initialize a list for new keys.  
- **Efficient Lookup with Hashing:** Use HashMaps for O(1) average-time lookups.  
- **Convert Arrays to Strings:** Use `new String(charArray)` after sorting.  
- **Common Signature Trick:** Reduce inputs to a pattern (sorted or frequency-based) to group similar items.  

**Tip:** For pattern-matching problems, **"Common pattern â†’ HashMap grouping"** is the go-to approach! ðŸ’¡


### Key Points to Remember from This Solution:  

- **Frequency Counting as a Key:** Instead of sorting, use character counts to represent patterns.  
- **`int[]` for Frequency:** Create an integer array of length 26 to track character frequencies (faster than sorting).  
- **Use `Arrays.toString()` for Key:** Convert the frequency array to a string to use as a HashMap key.  
- **`putIfAbsent()` for Quick Initialization:** Efficiently create a new list if the key doesn't exist.  
- **Pattern-Based Grouping:** Focus on creating a unique signature for similar patterns (like anagrams).  
- **Better for Large Inputs:** Frequency counting is faster than sorting for very large arrays of strings.  

### **Rule of Thumb for Pattern Problems:**  
**"When the order of characters doesnâ€™t matter, use frequency counting as the pattern key."** ðŸ’¡
