### 1️⃣ **Tech MCQ**
**Topics:**  
- DSA: Arrays, Linked List, Trees, Sorting  
- OOPs, DBMS, OS, CN  
- Complexity (Big O)  
- Some logic puzzles  

**Tips:**  
- Revise all basics fast ⚡  
- Know how each data structure works and its complexity  
- Do mock quizzes on InterviewBit, GeeksforGeeks

---

### 2️⃣ **Subjective Round**
**Questions like:**  
- Design a feature (e.g., parking lot system, library system)  
- Explain recursion vs iteration with example  
- Write logic in plain language  
- How to optimize an algorithm  

**Tips:**  
- Think out loud 🧠  
- Always cover edge cases  
- Avoid overusing `if-else`; aim for clean logic  
- Clarify the problem before answering

### 3️⃣ **Coding Round**
**Questions like:**  
- Medium/Hard Leetcode-style problems  
- 2-3 problems on strings, DP, trees, sliding window, etc.  
- Time & space optimization matters  
- No auto-complete—write in plain text  

**Tips:**  
- First go brute-force, then optimize  
- Write full working code, even if not optimal  
- Talk while solving—share your thought process  
- Practice under time pressure (30-40 mins per 2 Qs)
